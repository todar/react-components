Welcome! This is my library of React Components. Looking for some wobbly words, then you came to the correct place!

Obviously this is quite limited as of now, but star it, watch it, and it will grow!

![Demo](https://github.com/todar/react-components/blob/master/packages/wobble-words/wobble.gif)

```js
import React from "react";
import WobbleWords from "@todar/react-wobble-words";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <WobbleWords>Each word should wobble on mouseEnter</WobbleWords>
    </div>
  );
};
```
